top_issues:
  - id: 'TEST-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'DeviceInformation is sealed Windows Runtime class - unit test coverage for GetPropertyValue<T> helper relies on integration tests only'
    suggested_action: 'Accept as technical limitation; ensure integration tests cover property extraction with real devices'
  - id: 'ARCH-001'
    severity: low
    finding: 'GetPropertyValue<T> is static method on service class, could be extracted to utility class for better separation'
    suggested_action: 'Consider refactoring to utility class in future cleanup sprint'

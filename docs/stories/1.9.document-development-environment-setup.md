# Story 1.9: Document Development Environment Setup

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** new developer joining the project,
**I want** comprehensive setup instructions in the README,
**so that** I can configure my environment and start developing quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. README.md includes sections:
   - Project description and goals (brief, 2-3 sentences)
   - Prerequisites (Windows 10/11, .NET 8.0 SDK, VS Code)
   - VS Code extensions required (C# Dev Kit, C#, GitLens)
   - Step-by-step setup instructions:
     - Clone repository
     - Install Windows App SDK templates
     - Restore dependencies
     - Build solution
     - Run application
     - Run tests
   - How to debug in VS Code (F5 to launch)
   - How to run CI/CD locally (dotnet commands)
   - Contributing guidelines placeholder
2. Instructions tested by following them on a clean machine/VM (or documented as validated)
3. Common troubleshooting section with known issues (e.g., Windows SDK version mismatches)
4. Links to external documentation (WinUI3 docs, .NET 8 docs)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Source:** [Story 1.8 Dev Agent Record]

- **CRITICAL:** Platform must be `x64` for all build/test commands (WinUI3 doesn't support AnyCPU)
- Build command: `dotnet build -p:Platform=x64`
- Test command: `dotnet test -p:Platform=x64`
- Release build command: `dotnet build -c Release -p:Platform=x64`
- Windows App SDK version: **1.8.250907003**
- Current build: **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- Current tests: **1/1 passing**
- VS Code F5 debugging works with existing launch.json configuration

### Current README.md State

**Source:** [README.md]

The README.md currently has:
- Build status badge (keep this)
- Project title and description (2-3 sentences - meets AC requirement)
- Placeholder Prerequisites section (needs expansion)
- Placeholder Setup Instructions section (needs full content)
- License section (keep this)

### Existing VS Code Configuration

**Source:** [.vscode/]

Files already configured that should be referenced in documentation:
- `.vscode/launch.json` - Configured for F5 debugging with coreclr
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build, test, and run tasks defined
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommends C# Dev Kit extension

### Tech Stack Reference

**Source:** [architecture/tech-stack.md]

Key versions to document:
| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| .NET SDK | 8.0.101+ | Build tools and compiler |
| C# | 12.0 | Language version |
| Windows App SDK | 1.8.250907003 | UI framework |

**Files to MODIFY:**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Update with comprehensive setup documentation |

**No new files required for this story.**

### External Documentation Links

Links to include in README:
- WinUI3: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/
- .NET 8: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8
- Windows App SDK: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/

### Known Troubleshooting Issues

**Source:** [Previous story completion notes and architecture docs]

Issues to document:
1. **Platform must be x64** - WinUI3 doesn't support AnyCPU; all dotnet commands need `-p:Platform=x64`
2. **Windows SDK version mismatch** - Ensure Windows 10 SDK 10.0.19041.0 is installed
3. **Windows App SDK templates** - Must be installed before creating new WinUI3 projects
4. **CI build failures** - Ensure Platform=x64 is specified in workflow

### Testing

**Source:** [architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Testing Requirements for Story 1.9:**

This is a documentation-only story. No automated tests required.

**Verification Method:**
1. Review README.md for completeness against all AC items
2. Manually follow the documented setup instructions to verify accuracy
3. Verify all external links are valid and accessible
4. Check that troubleshooting section covers known issues from previous stories

**No code changes - documentation only story.**

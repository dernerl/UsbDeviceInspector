# Story 1.1: Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

**Ready for Review**

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured Git repository with the monorepo layout,
**so that** I can organize code, documentation, and configuration files according to the architectural plan.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub repository created with name `UsbDeviceInspector` and MIT License
2. Repository README.md includes project title, brief description, and placeholder for setup instructions
3. Directory structure matches Technical Assumptions specification:
   - `src/` (source code root)
   - `docs/` (documentation including PRD)
   - `.vscode/` (VS Code configuration)
   - `.github/workflows/` (CI/CD pipelines)
4. `.gitignore` file configured for .NET projects (excludes `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`, etc.)
5. Repository cloned locally and verified accessible

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories exist - this is the first story of the project.

### Repository Structure Requirements

**Source:** [Source: prd/technical-assumptions.md#repository-structure-monorepo]

The monorepo structure must follow this exact layout:
```
UsbDeviceInspector/
├── src/                              # Source code root
│   ├── UsbDeviceInspector/          # Main WinUI3 project (created in Story 1.2)
│   │   ├── Views/                    # XAML views
│   │   ├── ViewModels/               # MVVM ViewModels
│   │   ├── Models/                   # Data models
│   │   ├── Services/                 # Business logic services
│   │   └── Assets/                   # Icons, images
│   └── UsbDeviceInspector.Tests/    # Unit tests (created in Story 1.3)
├── .vscode/                          # VS Code configuration
├── docs/                             # Documentation (PRD, architecture)
├── .github/workflows/                # CI/CD pipeline definitions
└── README.md                         # Project overview
```

**Source:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Complete directory structure reference shows:
- `.github/workflows/` contains CI/CD pipeline (`build.yml` created in Story 1.6)
- `.vscode/` contains debugging configuration (created in Story 1.4)
- `docs/` contains PRD, architecture diagrams, user personas
- `src/` is the root for all C# projects

### Git Configuration

**License:** MIT License (most permissive, allows commercial use, maximizes community adoption)
[Source: prd/technical-assumptions.md#open-source-license]

**Repository Name:** `UsbDeviceInspector` (exact name specified in acceptance criteria)

**Branching Strategy:** GitHub Flow (main + feature branches, no separate develop branch)
[Source: prd/technical-assumptions.md#version-control-ci-cd]

### .gitignore Requirements

**Source:** [Source: prd/technical-assumptions.md#development-environment]

Must exclude .NET build artifacts:
- `bin/` - Compiled binaries directory
- `obj/` - Intermediate build objects
- `.vs/` - Visual Studio cache files
- `*.user` - User-specific project settings
- `*.suo` - Solution user options
- `packages/` - NuGet package cache (if using packages.config, though .NET 8 uses PackageReference)
- Build artifacts from Windows App SDK compilation

**Additional Exclusions:**
- `.vscode/settings.json` may contain user-specific paths (should be in .gitignore)
- `.editorconfig` SHOULD be committed (defines formatting rules for team)
- `*.nupkg` - NuGet package files

### README.md Content Structure

**Source:** [Source: prd/epic-1-project-foundation-development-environment-setup.md#story-19]

Initial README must include:
- Project title: "USB Device Inspector"
- Brief description (2-3 sentences about purpose)
- Placeholder for Prerequisites section (to be populated in Story 1.9)
- Placeholder for Setup Instructions (to be populated in Story 1.9)

Full documentation will be added in Story 1.9 after the complete development environment is established.

### Project Purpose Context

**Source:** [Source: prd/epic-1-project-foundation-development-environment-setup.md]

Brief description for README should communicate:
- Desktop application for IT administrators
- Enumerates USB storage devices and extracts hardware identifiers
- Generates formatted output for CrowdStrike Falcon Device Control and helpdesk systems
- Offline-only tool with no telemetry

### Technology Stack Context

**Source:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

While not directly used in this story, context for README:
- .NET 8.0 LTS desktop application
- WinUI3 with Fluent Design
- Requires Windows 10/11
- Open source tool for IT administrators

### File Locations for This Story

**Story 1.1 Creates:**
- `/README.md` - Root level project overview
- `/.gitignore` - Root level Git exclusions
- `/src/` - Empty directory (projects added in Stories 1.2 and 1.3)
- `/docs/` - Empty directory (documentation added later)
- `/.vscode/` - Empty directory (configurations added in Story 1.4)
- `/.github/workflows/` - Empty directory (CI/CD added in Story 1.6)

**Does NOT Create:**
- No `.csproj` files (Story 1.2 creates .NET projects)
- No `.sln` file (Story 1.2 creates solution)
- No code files (subsequent stories)
- No VS Code configurations (Story 1.4)

### Testing

**Source:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Testing Requirements for Story 1.1:**

This story establishes repository infrastructure only. No unit tests are required for this story because:
- No code is written (only directory structure and configuration files)
- Repository creation and .gitignore configuration are validated manually
- Verification is done by cloning and inspecting the repository

**Test Strategy Overview for Future Stories:**
- Test files mirror source structure in `src/UsbDeviceInspector.Tests/`
- Test framework: xUnit 2.6.6
- Assertion library: FluentAssertions 6.12.0
- Mocking framework: NSubstitute 5.1.0
- Test naming convention: `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`
- Test file naming convention: `{ClassUnderTest}Tests.cs`

**Coverage Targets (for future service/ViewModel code):**
- Service layer: 80%+ line coverage
- ViewModel layer: 70%+ coverage
- Overall project: 75%+ coverage excluding UI layer

**Manual Validation for Story 1.1:**
1. Verify repository created on GitHub with MIT License
2. Verify directory structure matches specification
3. Verify .gitignore excludes .NET build artifacts
4. Verify repository can be cloned successfully
5. Verify README contains required placeholder content

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - infrastructure setup story with no code implementation.

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created comprehensive monorepo directory structure per architectural requirements
- Configured .NET-specific .gitignore with Windows App SDK exclusions
- Created README.md with project description and placeholder sections for future setup documentation
- Initialized git repository with proper user configuration (dernerl/danielhug2@gmail.com)
- Created initial commit (0a01495) with all project documentation

**Manual Step Required:**
GitHub repository creation and remote push requires manual action:
1. Create `UsbDeviceInspector` repository on GitHub with MIT License
2. Configure remote: `git remote add origin <github-url>`
3. Push initial commit: `git push -u origin master`

**Testing Approach:**
Manual validation completed per story requirements (no unit tests required for infrastructure-only story):
- ✅ Directory structure verified (src/, docs/, .vscode/, .github/workflows/)
- ✅ .gitignore properly excludes .NET build artifacts
- ✅ README contains all required sections
- ✅ Git repository initialized and committed successfully

**No Issues Encountered**

### File List

**Created:**
- [README.md](../../README.md) - Project overview with description and setup placeholders
- [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) - Updated with .NET build artifact exclusions

**Created Directories:**

- [.vscode/](../../.vscode/) - VS Code configuration directory (empty, configs added in Story 1.4)
- [.github/workflows/](../../.github/workflows/) - CI/CD pipeline directory (empty, pipelines added in Story 1.6)
